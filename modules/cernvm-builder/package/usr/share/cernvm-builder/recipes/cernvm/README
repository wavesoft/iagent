1. SCRIPTS
--------------

This folder contains the steering files that will be copied
inside the VM and will launch the building process. The user
can overwrite one or all of them...

Scripts description in the order they run:

    pre-init            : (Overriden by user)
    init                : Runned right when VM is booted
                          This script mounts the appropriate partition, setups the appropriate filesystems
                          and initializes the build process.
    post-init           : (Overriden by used)
    
    pre-build           : (Overriden by user)
    build               : Called when init finishes successfully, it starts the conary job, does some post-build
                          configuration and setups bootloader.
    post-build          : (Overriden by user)

    pre-chroot          : (Overriden by user)
    chroot              : Scripts that dould be run inside the chroot environment
    post-chroot         : (Overriden by user)

    pre-finalize        : (Overriden by user)
    finalize            : Called when build finishes. It collects the stdout files, unmounts, cleanups and 
                          shuts down the machine.

For every script, all the command-line arguments passed to start.sh are still
available as CMD_<parameter> global variables...
